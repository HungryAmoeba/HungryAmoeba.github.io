      Hi there! I am a first year PhD student in computer science at MIT where I am fortunate to be advised by [JÃ¶rn Dunkel](https://math.mit.edu/~dunkel/). In my research I seek to develop computational methods which can discover the physical and mathematical structure underlying living systems. My work utilizes ideas from geometric algebra, machine learning, and dynamics identification. 

      Previously I studied applied math and chemistry at Yale, where I worked in [Smita Krishnaswamy's](https://krishnaswamylab.org) lab to develop graph representation learning methods to study high dimensional biological data.
